This provides a script for converting a JSTOR data for research citations file (.csv) into a JSON catalog file of the format required by bookworm (http://bookworm.culturomics.org/). 

You need the file created by the script (which should be named *jsoncatalog.txt*), a file called *field_descriptions.json*, and a directory with the full text files to create your own bookworm. A stripped-down, functional version of *field_descriptions.json* is provided in this directory.

For details on how to create your own bookworm, see http://bookworm.culturomics.org/docs.php 

For the more ambitious, see Ben Schmidt's more complex bookworm projects at http://benschmidt.org/2014/08/29/the-simpsons-bookworm/
